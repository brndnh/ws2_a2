                                It's a Tuesday school afternoon and I'm kinda bored out of my mind, so I decided to finally hit that idea that's been bouncing around in the back of my head for quite some time.

                                I've been posting on an Instagram private account in recent time documenting previous travel experiences from 2023 while attempting to write out more sophisticated descriptions, and a friend of mine pushed the idea that I should start writing actual blogs instead of posting to an audience of 30 followers on priv.  I've thought about how its pretty nonsensical sometimes to be writing so much for such a small group of people I'm not even that close with haha.

                                It's been ages since I've properly written a blog, as I would usually just jot down my thoughts informally in broken texts or just in a DM with a friend but why not step outside the norm and try something new?
                            </p>

                            <p>
                                Some ambitious thoughts from here on. In the future, I've also thought about digital journalling in a different language that I'm learning. Maybe if some of my thoughts are interesting and well expanded on enough when the time is right, I'll also consider creating video essays on YouTube because that's also on my imaginary bucket list of things I want to try!
